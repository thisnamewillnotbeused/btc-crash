# btc-crash
Github development repo for the btc-crash (still in development) <a href='http://btc-crash.ml'>Website.</a> BTC-Crash is a Crash Gambling site that uses Bitcoin, as well as many other altcoins. 
<h1>What is Crash?</h1>
<p>Crash is very simple. You place a bet for the next round, and then a graph begins to steadily increase from 0.0x. This multiplier has a variable increase rate per second. Here's the interesting part- The graph can <i>"Crash"</i> at any moment, meaning that it drops to 0.0x, and you lose whatever bet you had put in. You can take your bet out at any time, however. You just have to trust yourself to take your earnings before it's gone... Or don't and push your luck ;).</p>

<h1>How do I know it's not a scam?</h1>

BTC-Crash uses Provably Fair (note pro<i><u><b>v</b></u></i>ably fair, not pro<u><b><i>b</i></b></u>ably fair, as I have seen a few people confuse these.) which means that you can view and verify the randomness of each and every game. We realize that you may be a bit skeptical, considering to many this is an entirely new concept, and if you have any questions, please email support@btc-crash.ml.

<h1>Who are the developers?</h1>

<h1>Can I clone this and run my own site?</h1>
Nope. This open-source software on a site where people share projects with each other, cannot be cloned because we said so ;)
In all seriousness, we wish that you do clone the site for testing and development purposes but do not wish for you to try to make a replica of our site on the web.
