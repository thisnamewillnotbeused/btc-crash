You place a bet for the next round, and then a graph begins to steadily increase from 0.0x. This multiplier has a variable increase rate per second. Here's the interesting part- The graph can <i>\"Crash\"</i> at any moment, meaning that it drops to 0.0x, and you lose whatever bet you had put in. You can take your bet out at any time, however. You just have to trust yourself to take your earnings before it's gone... Or don't and push your luck ;).</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>How do I know it's not a scam?</h1>\r\n\r\nBTC-Crash uses Provably Fair (note pro<i><u><b>v</b></u></i>ably fair, not pro<u><b><i>b</i></b></u>ably fair, as I have seen a few people confuse these.) which means that you chan view and verify the randomness of each and every game. We realize that you may be a bit skeptical, considering to many this is an entirely new concept, and if you have any questions, please email support@btc-crash.ml.\r\n\r\n<h1>Who are the developers?</h1>\r\nYou can find the developers here on github @ https://github.com/austinbro1000 and https://github.com/thisnamewillnotbeused\r\n\r\n<h1>I love this idea! Where can I contribute?</h1>\r\n================\r\nCHECK BACK SOON\r\n================\r\nYou can contribute via donations to any of our Official Dev Wallets. These wallets are specifically for development and initial funding for the site's bankroll. Anyone who donates more than 0.005 BTC worth of a currency should send an email to donatebonus@BTC-Crash.ml with your TXID.

This open-source software on a site where people share projects with each other, cannot be cloned because we said so ;)\r\n",
