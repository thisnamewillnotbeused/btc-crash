<p>Crash is very simple. You place a bet for the next round, and then a graph begins to steadily increase from 0.0x. This multiplier has a variable increase rate per second. Here's the interesting part- The graph can <i>"Crash"</i> at any moment, meaning that it drops to 0.0x, and you lose whatever bet you had put in. You can take your bet out at any time, however. You just have to trust yourself to take your earnings before it's gone... Or don't and push your luck ;).</p>

<p>BTC-Crash uses Provably Fair (note pro<i><b>v</b></i>ably fair, not pro<b><i>b</i></b>ably fair, as I have seen a few people confuse these.) which means that you chan view and verify the randomness of each and every game. We realize that you may be a bit skeptical, considering to many this is an entirely new concept, and if you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:support@btc-crash.ml">support@btc-crash.ml</a>.</p>
